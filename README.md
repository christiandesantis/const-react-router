## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Code Quality

This template uses Biome for linting and formatting:

```bash
# Check for issues
pnpm check

# Fix issues automatically
pnpm check --fix

# Format code
pnpm format

# Lint code
pnpm lint
```

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

To build and run using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t my-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
```

The containerized application can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker, including:

- AWS ECS
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Apps
- Digital Ocean App Platform
- Fly.io
- Railway

### DIY Deployment

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `pnpm build`

```
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json (or pnpm-lock.yaml, or bun.lockb)
├── build/
│   ├── client/    # Static assets
│   └── server/    # Server-side code
```

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are handled with type safety using Zod validation in `app/lib/env.ts`. Add your variables to `.env` and define their schema for runtime validation.

## React Compiler (Release Candidate)

This template includes the React Compiler release candidate (`babel-plugin-react-compiler: 19.1.0-rc.2`) which provides automatic optimization for React components. 

> ⚠️ **Note**: This is a release candidate version and may have stability issues. It's currently included as a development dependency but not actively configured.

### Removing React Compiler (Optional)

If you prefer not to use the React Compiler RC, you can remove it:

```bash
# Remove React Compiler dependencies
pnpm remove babel-plugin-react-compiler eslint-plugin-react-hooks
```

## Hooks

### Dark Mode
```tsx
import useDark from "~/hooks/use-dark";

const { isDark, toggleDark } = useDark();
```

### Mobile Detection
```tsx
import { useIsMobile } from "~/hooks/use-mobile";

const isMobile = useIsMobile();
```

## Included Libraries & Utilities

### Type Validation
- **Zod** - Runtime type validation and schema parsing
- Type-safe environment variable handling

### Icons & UI
- **Lucide React** - 1000+ beautiful, customizable icons
- **Tailwind Merge** + **clsx** - Utility for merging Tailwind classes

### Development Tools
- **React Router DevTools** - Enhanced debugging for routing and data loading
- **Biome** - Fast, modern linter and formatter
- **TypeScript** - Full type safety throughout the application

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [TW Animate CSS](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/tw-animate-css) for enhanced animations already configured. The setup is compatible with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components for rapid UI development.

## Technical Notes

### Development Experience Improvements
- **Clean Console**: Custom Vite middleware silently handles Chrome DevTools requests (e.g., `/.well-known/` URLs) to prevent console noise during development
- **CJS Warning Suppression**: Environment variable `VITE_CJS_IGNORE_WARNING=true` suppresses deprecated CJS API warnings from React Router dependencies
